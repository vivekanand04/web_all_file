1)..... unordered_map<char, int> mpp ;
      if(mpp['a'] && mpp['b']{
	  count++; }
matlab ham map me character 'a' hai ya nahi aise ham pta kar sakte hai	  
            
 2)  default value of map is 0
           map<int,int>mp;
           cout<<mp[4];
           ans:  0   
3.)a.) The time complexity for searching elements in std::map is O(log n). 
   b.) unordered_map best case and average case time complexity for searching is O(1) because elements are stored in a Hash table and therefore the key acts as an index while searching in unordered maps.
 But the worst-case time complexity for searching is O(N).  
 hint: if all elements are hashed to the same bucket, the complexity becomes linear in the size of the map, because the new element needs to be inserted into a bucket that already contains ( n ) elements, making it necessary to traverse through all of them.  
4)   map<char,int>mp;
    case 1: mp[a]++;
    cout<<mp[a]   ......ans=1;  //1 se increment ho gaya
 case 2:  now khuraphati karte hai
   mp[a]--;
   cout<<mp[a];   ......ans=0;
   mp[a]--;
  cout<<mp[a];   ......ans=-1;
