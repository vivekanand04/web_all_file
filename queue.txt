 First Unique Character in a String.................5x
 1)vector<int> charsMemo(128, 0); creates a vector of integers called charsMemo with 128 elements. Each element in the vector is initialized to 0.
 2) arr[A]={6}; array me 65 index pr value 6 store hoga,,agae ye arr vector hota to bhi kaam kar jaata
3)451 Sort Characters By Frequency....its about priority queue
1631. Path With Minimum Effort.....priority queue ke andar int nahi vector use karna ,insert karna sikhoge..
4)there is no any predefined function to find element and delete element in queue;
  .....so use deque if required and process is given below
                 deque<int>deq; 
                auto it = find(deq.begin(), deq.end(), pages[i]);
                 deq.erase(it);
